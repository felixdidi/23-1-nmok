    "section": "What is it about?",
    "text": "What is it about?\nWhat is the role of digital media use for our psychological health and well-being? Although widely debated in academia and society at large, research findings on the effects of using digital communication technologies on users’ psychological well-being are rather ambiguous, because digital media use can both harm and contribute to it. Recently, these conflicting forces emerging from digital communication and constant mobile connectedness have been described as the “mobile connectivity paradox”, suggesting that digital communication can both empower individuals by providing new avenues for self-determined behavior and impede personal freedom through social expectations and connectedness pressure. Consequently, “digital autonomy”, that is, the individual ability to use digital media in a self-determined way, has been proposed as a key determinant of the effects of digital communication on well-being. In this seminar, we will discuss existing approaches to digital autonomy and the need for better theoretical integration of various perspectives on the topic. In interactive sessions, you will learn how to efficiently and interactively map a diverse research landscape. Through this, you will be able to extract information that can be useful for both research and practice."

    "text": "What will I do?\nThe class will be conduct through weekly live sessions. Lectures will not be streamed and will not be recorded. Most course materials will be provided through this course website. However, all students participating in the class need to also have access to the virtual learning space on the Moodle platform, because confidential class materials might be provided/shared via Moodle and exercises have to be submitted there.\nRegular Performance:\nAll students wishing to receive credit for the class are obliged to engage in the following types of regular performance. These tasks will not be graded. However: If you fail to engage in these tasks, you cannot pass the class.\n\nPrepare for the live sessions: To prepare for a live session, please refer to the “prepare” column in the course overview. For example, you may be required to read some literature, and/or you will be provided with a few questions. You should be able to provide an answer to these questions in class. Preparation material may be added throughout the semester, so please check the course website regularly and in time before the next session.\nExercises: To practice your competence with the topics that are covered in this class, you will sometimes be provided with practical exercises at the end of a lesson (see also the “exercise” column in the course overview). These exercises have to be submitted by all students until the following Sunday night via Moodle.\nWiki Entry (Individual Submission): In sessions 5-8, we will collaboratively work on a wiki that collects entries about research on digital autonomy. Specifically, we will cover a broad range of research areas from digital media use to digital power structures. Each student must commit one wiki entry to the shared repository on GitHub no later than June 11.\nSystematization & Synthesis (Group Project): In sessions 9-13, we will work together on collecting, systematizing and synthesizing the heterogeneous research landscape on digital autonomy. Each student needs to participate in this group project as well as the presentation of the results in class.\n\nGraded Performance:\nTo receive a grade for this class, you must submit a written term paper (~ 10-12 pages) as part of the Systematization & Synthesis Group Project.\n\nA: Group Submission: The term paper can be submitted by the entire group and will be graded as a group project.\nB: Individual Submission: If you prefer an individual grade, you have to highlight individual contributions within the paper.\nC: No Submission: Students who study Publizistik as a minor subject (“Beifach”) can decide whether they want to write the term paper for this course or in the Media Use Research seminar. Exchange students may also not need to receive a grade. In both cases, please communicate this as soon as possible so that we can plan accordingly."

What might be implications for studying digital autonomy?\nCan you think of examples that are similar to the empirical studies described in the chapter, but relate to digital media use?\nDid you find anything odd while reading the chapter? Can you identify aspects that might be worthy of critique?"

    "text": "Defining Autonomy Need Experiences\n\n\n“Autonomy refers to the experience of volition, willingness, and authenticity in one’s actions, thoughts, and feelings. Autonomy reflects integrity, as one is ‘in unison’ with regard to one’s aims and actions. When frustrated, one experiences a sense of pressure and inner conflict, thereby feeling pushed in an unwanted direction.\nRelatedness denotes the experience of warmth, bonding, and care and is satisfied when one feels connected to significant others. Relatedness frustration involves a sense of social alienation, exclusion, and loneliness. Competence concerns the experience of effectiveness and mastery. When frustrated, one experiences a sense of failure and helplessness.”\nVansteenkiste et al. (2023, p. 85)\n\n\n\n\nVansteenkiste, M., Soenens, B., & Ryan, R. M. (2023).

    "text": "The goal of the wiki project is to create a collection of summaries about empirical research literature on digital autonomy. This collection will later be useful for systematizing and mapping the broad research landscape.\n\n\n\nThe most important aspect of this exercise is to select a paper that is both relevant with regard to the research area that you have been assigned to as well as a typical example of research from this area. To achieve this…\n\n…do NOT randomly select one paper that seems fitting and simply complete the exercise regarding that paper\n…gain an overview of the research area first and then decide on one paper that can be considered a typical example of research from that field\n\nTo gain this overview, you will need to read several papers. Here is some advice on how to do this:\n\nDo not read the papers in full, but concentrate on the relevant aspects (check title, abstract, subheadings, and conclusion first)\nUse your knowledge about working with scientific literature from the class “Reading scientific literature”\nUse keywords from the topic model for your search\nTry to expand your search by discovering and adding new search terms (try wildcards and synonyms; use boolean operators and quotation marks)\nUse a combination of search tools (Databases, e.g., Communication Abstracts; Google Scholar; Backward Search / Forward Search)\nUse the literature base collected by Felix (will be provided in Session 06)\nTry to develop useful inclusion and exclusion criteria (i.e., how can you determine, optimally by just reading the abstract, if the paper is potentially relevant to you)\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have decided on one paper, start by answering the following KARQ-questions:\n\nSelect a (K) Key Quote from the article that provides a good summary of the article. The Key Quote should be a quote of one sentence and not a whole paragraph.\nDescribe in one paragraph what is the main (A) Argument of the article from which you have picked the Key Quote. Summarize in your own words the main theoretical argument expressed in this article. Here you do not use any direct citations.\nDiscuss the (R) Relationship between the argument in the study and the theoretical arguments put forward in the other articles that you have read from this research area.\nFinally, formulate two (Q) Questions that originate from the findings of the presented research and arguments. For instance, think about issues that are not addressed in this particular literature or about what could be a relevant future research question based on the findings or limitations of the presented study.\n\nAfter you have finished the KARQ, add a summary of ~300 Words (+/-20) to your wiki entry that provides a bit more detail about the present study. Try to answer the following questions: - What are the theoretical mechanisms that are proposed to connect digital media use and autonomy need experiences? - To what extent does the study focus on individual perceptions of digital autonomy or autonomy need experiences that relate to digital media use? - How are (individual perceptions of) digital autonomy (or autonomy need experiences) and their relationship to digital media use studied empirically?\n\n\n\nUse the template wiki_entry.qmd which can be found in the wiki/ subfolder of the repository. Synchronize the current state from the base class repository to your fork to get access to this template.\nYou can work on and commit changes to your own fork until next week if you want to, but do not create a new pull request yet. More info will follow in the next session.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to save your entry with the file extension .qmd (not .txt, .docx or anything else!)\nMake sure to save your file in the right place within the repository!\nYou can either use and IDE that is dedicated for editing such files (e.g., RStudio or Visual Studio Code)\nIf you do not have these programs installed, you can use a plain text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on MacOS)\nAlternatively, you can edit the file right on GitHub by selecting the file and clicking “edit in place” or open it in “github.dev” (i.e., Visual Studio Code in the Browser)"
