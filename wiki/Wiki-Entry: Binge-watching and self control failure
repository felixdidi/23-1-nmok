Binge-watching: New opportunities for autonomy or self control failure?

Granow, V. C., Reinecke, L., & Ziegele, M. (2018). Binge-watching and psychological well-being: Media use between lack of control and perceived autonomy. Communication Research Reports, 35(5), 392-401.


***(K) Key Quote*** from the article 
“Binge watching provides new opportunities for self-determined forms of entertainment consumption and can positively influence media enjoyment and well-being through perceived autonomy.” (Granow, Reinecke & Ziegele, 2018, S. 9.) 

***(A) Main Argument*** of the article 
In their study, Granow and colleagues try to focus on if and how binge-watching, which in previous research has mostly been connected to negative effects on well-being and self-control failure in a digital media setting, could potentially have positive effects on the user’s eudaemonic aspects of well-being, being autonomy, competence, and relatedness. They do find that in some cases binge-watching is related to feelings of guilt, self-control failure, and goal conflict, but the results also show that at the same time, it is positively correlated with recovery experiences, enjoyment, and, most importantly, perceived autonomy. 
I have chosen this exact study because it focuses on binge-watching which could be described as an almost addictional use of digital media with addiction being an aspect of digital media use in the computational scoping review that immediately caught my eye. 

***(R) Relationship*** between the argument in the study and the theoretical arguments put forward in the other articles 
Prof. Dr. Reinecke is a well-known author of research that focuses on the effects of media use, thus making almost every text of his a typical text in the research area of digital media use. In “Self-regulation as a key boundary condition in the relationship between social media use and well-being”, Reinecke and his colleagues propose the idea that digital media use can have positive and negative effects on the well-being and satisfaction of intrinsic needs of an individual (Reinecke et al., 2022); very similar to the here mentioned study.
A very interesting aspect of this paper though is, that they find that originally intrinsic motivations, such as staying connected, through extrinsic pressure can turn into feelings of being forced and thus undermining perceived autonomy (Reinecke et al., 2022, p.4). This aspect would have been an interesting perspective when looking at binge-watching behaviour.  
As Castro and colleagues state in their paper, the introduction of Video on Demand-platforms (VoD) has transformed the ways that the audience watches TV (Castro et al., 2021). It opens new forms of self-determined digital media experiences and thus enhances “the level of control that viewers have over what they watch” (Castro et al., 2021, p. 1); completely new opportunities for autonomous digital media use.
Interestingly, though, they find that binge-watching is, all in all, a pretty awarely used way of dealing with situations. In more than half the cases, the participants watched only for as long as they intended (Castro et al., 2021, p. 15), which plays into the idea of Granow et al. that binge-watching is also positively correlated to recovery experiences and (perceived) autonomy.
In a wide range of research, in general, it is shown that a general feeling of lacking autonomy leads individuals to binge-watching (e.g., Masur et al., 2014) as it proposes a way of deciding for oneself how long, what, and where they wanna watch something.
A good summary or maybe even a slight extension of the idea of Granow and her colleagues in the here presented study is that of users only being able to retrieve the positive outcomes of digital media use if they manage to actually use it in a self-controlled and moderate way so that it increases their (perceived) autonomy rather than undermining it by giving them the feeling of missing self-regulation (Hofmann et al., 2017).
Overall, the research put forward in this wiki-entry focuses on binge-watching as a moderately new way of how individuals can autonomously control their own digital media use.
Granow, Reinecke and Ziegele proposed the idea of binge-watching potentially having positive outcomes for users such as autonomy need satisfaction, or the opportunity to recover from daily life. Even though they suggested this perspective as a more novel way of looking at binge-watching as a phenomenon, my literature research revealed that previous authors had similar ideas.
Nevertheless, I chose the study by Granow et al. because it's a good introductory text that covers the most important aspects altogether and on top of that uses a cross-sectional online survey, which poses to be the most typical, but maybe not the best, way of examining digital media use and gave the reader a good overview of current results. 

***Two (Q) Questions*** to the text
* In a longitudinal design, could an effect of digital media use on psychological well-being also be shown at a later time? Or does it only affect and/or satisfy short-term need experiences? (see telic hedonism) 
* Do different methods such as interviews, ESM-designs, experiments, etc. all give the same results on the effects of binge-watching? 




***Short summary***
Granow, Reinecke and Ziegele want to study how binge-watching affects the well-being of individuals. For that they first differentiate between subjective well-being which consists of positive and negative affect but also overall life satisfaction. The research group at hand here focuses on psychological well-being, which consists of relatedness, competence, and autonomy (Ryan & Deci, 2001). Binge-watching addresses all three of these aspects: In watching the shows one’s own peers watch, one stays connected. At the same time, binge-watching behaviour asks for at least a little amount of competence, but most importantly offers the viewer almost unlimited autonomy in what, how, where, and when they watch said shows. 
With the help of an online survey among 499 participants, the researchers tested whether binge-watching is awakening feelings of guilt or autonomy which either reduce or enhance media enjoyment, recovery experiences, and vitality. The study exclusively focuses and when and how the participants feel autonomous when binge-watching because they use 5-point-scales that reach from ”strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” to answer items like “I often watch multiple episodes of a series in a single setting” (Granow et al., 2018, p. 7, Granow et al., 2018. p. 5-8).
The results of the online survey show that binge-watching is correlated with goal conflicts and thus to feelings of guilt and negative recovery experiences. Surprisingly, it is not connected to a negative effect on media enjoyment. For autonomy, the data shows a highly significant correlation between binge-watching and perceived autonomy. Even higher significances are found between binge-watching and positive recovery experiences and media enjoyment, whereas binge-watching has no connection to vitality (Granow et al., 2018. p. 8-9). 
This paper shows that binge-watching can be a double-edged sword, granting unlimited autonomy but at the same time possibly leading to goal conflicts. It also suggests that those effects are not necessarily influenced by the consumed content but by the mode and level of self-determination.
