## K: Key Quote
"In general, we can state that variations in symbolic capital (i.e. legitimation), which we define as the number of mentions and replies one receives, are related to the positions the agents hold as politician, media or citizen agent. In addition, the variance in conversation practices on Twitter is significantly related to the different user types. Below, we wrap up the main findings and elaborate upon future theoretical endeavours and the limitations of the study." (DÂ´heer & Verdegem, 2014, p. 731)


## A: Argument
The main argument of the text is that Twitter has become an important platform for political communication and its role in shaping the political and media fields should be studied from a structural perspective. The authors argue that the interactions on Twitter during the elections reflect broader power relations and structures in society, which can be studied through network analysis and discourse analysis.

The main argument of the text is that Twitter has become an important platform for political communication and its role in the shaping of the political and media fields should be studied from a structural perspective. The authors argue that network and discourse analysis can be used to study how interactions on Twitter during the election reflect broader power relations and structures in society.


## R: Relationship
This argument is in line with the general theoretical argument that social media platforms are not neutral platforms, but are shaped by and shape social structures and power relations. The authors also draw on theories of the public sphere and media ecology to argue that Twitter has become a new space for political discourse. However, its influence should be studied in relation to traditional media and other social structures.

As a whole, the text highlights the importance of adopting a structural perspective in the study of the role of Twitter and other social media platforms in politics and the media. It also emphasises the need for interdisciplinary approaches combining communication, political science, sociology and other theories.


## Q:
1. Did the study take into account the potential impact of Twitter bots and fake accounts on the political conversations that took place during the elections?
2. How do demographic characteristics of Twitter users, such as age or gender, influence how they engage in political conversation during elections?



## Summmary:
The article "Conversations about the elections on Twitter: Towards a structural understanding of Twitter's relation with the political and the media field" by Evelien D'heer and Pieter Verdegem examines the use of Twitter in political conversations during the 2012 Belgian elections. The study aims to provide a structural understanding of Twitter's role in the political and media field.

The study collected data from Twitter conversations that included the election-related hashtag 'vk2012'. The analysis showed that Twitter played an important role in shaping public discourse during the elections. Twitter conversations focused primarily on political news and the exchange of opinions, while the use of the platform for direct political interaction remained limited.

The study analysed 43,447 messages from 11,658 users. The missing demographics could have influenced conversations on Twitter by amplifying the voices of certain segments of society and limiting the representation of others.

The study also identified the role of the media in shaping conversations on Twitter. Traditional media played a significant role in driving discussions on the platform, with journalists and news outlets being the most influential users.

The authors argue that Twitter's role in political conversations cannot be seen in isolation from the broader media system and the power dynamics that shape it. They suggest that a more nuanced understanding of the intersection of social media, traditional media and politics is needed to understand Twitter's role in shaping public discourse.
